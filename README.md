## Where to play

You can play this game online at my itch.io Page: https://silentbluedrop.itch.io/aquatetris

## Note

There are 4 types of tetromino：

- stone: normal tetromino 🧱
- lava: this will generate a vapour tetromino when it touches the water，and the burning block will destroy other block 🔥
- vapour:  this tetromino will move up 🎈☁
- styrofoam: this tetromino can not move into the water, so it stops on the surface of the water ⛵

enjoy this game 🎮💖
